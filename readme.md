# Blazor WASM XNA

![Alt text](screenshot.png)

## What Is This?

This is just a project I'm interested in. I used to use XNA for my game development and I loved it. I haven't had as much fun with MonoGame and I think it would be great to be able to program my games in C# and just deploying to web. So this is trying to make that happen utilizing Blazor WASM support. 

## Where Am I?

I'm at a very very very very early stage right now. All I've done is sort of prove that it can at least kind of work. I've pieced apart an example from henthoven (https://github.com/henthoven/BlazorFunExamples) and that just got me started.

Right now I've mostly just been pulling the logic out into a separate library. 

I hope to be able to pull MonoGame libraries in, see how it goes that way I can just port my xna games over with no changes to my original game code.
